# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10 - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

# Overview
The objective of this project is to extract the most recently published Mars articles' title and summary by finding the HTML components from multiple websites.

This reciprocity presents a web application on Mars data including live data from NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, GalaxyFacts.com, and the Astrogeology Science Center. Using DevTools to inspect the HTML elements and structure, Splinter to automate the web browser, BeautifulSoup to parse and extract HTML data, MongoDB to hold the scraped data, and Flask to present, the delivered web application includes different types of data including live text, tables, and images that can be updated with a click of a button. The Flask application also includes Bootstap components for styling and appearance.

## Steps:
1) Created scraping code in Jupyter Notebook using BeautifulSoup to test the code as it was written.

2) Converted the Jupyter Notebook ipynb scraping, Splinter and Flask code to Python scripts.

3) Jupyter Notebook file cannot automate the browser. Automation of the browser and the scraping functions requires Python to interact
