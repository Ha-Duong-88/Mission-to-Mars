Module 10 - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

# Overview
The objective of this project is to extract the most recently published article's title and summary by finding the HTML components on the NASA news website.

This reciprocity presents a web application on Mars data including live data from NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, GalaxyFacts.com, and the Astrogeology Science Center. Using DevTools to inspect, Splinter to automate the web browser, BeautifulSoup to parse and extract HTML data, MongoDB to hold the scraped data, and Flask to present, the delivered web application includes different types of data including live text, tables, and images that can be updated with a click of a button. The Flask application also includes Bootstap components for styling and appearance.
